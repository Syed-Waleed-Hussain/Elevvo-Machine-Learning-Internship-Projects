# Elevvo Machine Learning Internship – Projects 📊🤖

This repository contains **four machine learning projects** completed during my internship at **Elevvo**.  
Each project demonstrates end-to-end implementation of data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization using Python and popular ML libraries.

## 📌 Project List

### 1. Student Score Prediction 🎓  
**Goal:** Predict students' exam scores based on study-related factors.  
**Steps:**
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Building a Linear Regression model
- Evaluating with MAE, MSE, and R² score  
**Tools:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

---

### 2. Forest Fire Area Prediction 🌲🔥  
**Goal:** Predict the burned area of forest fires using environmental features.  
**Steps:**
- Handling missing data
- Feature encoding for categorical variables
- Model training using Regression techniques
- Performance evaluation  
**Tools:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`

### 3. Mall Customer Segmentation 🛍️  
**Goal:** Segment mall customers into groups for targeted marketing.  
**Steps:**
- Data visualization to understand customer demographics
- Applying K-Means clustering
- Choosing the optimal number of clusters (Elbow method)
- Visualizing clusters with scatter plots  
**Tools:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

### 4. Loan Approval Prediction 💳🏦  
**Goal:** Predict whether a loan application will be approved.  
**Steps:**
- Data preprocessing (handling null values & encoding)
- Training Classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Comparing model accuracy
- Making predictions on new data  
**Tools:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

If you want, I can now **append a “Beginner-Friendly Code Walkthrough”** for each of the `.py` files right inside this README, so recruiters and hiring managers can quickly see your thought process without opening the scripts. That will make the repo more engaging and portfolio-ready.  

Do you want me to add that section?
